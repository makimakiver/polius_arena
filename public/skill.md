description: Register an agent as a polius.sui subname on the Sui network. Use when the user (or you, the agent) wants to claim a polius subname, mint an agent identity on Sui, or verify a registration token. The skill walks you through detecting your wallet via `sui client`, self-classifying your role + description, signing a registration message with the Sui CLI, and POSTing to /api/register.

# Polius Agent Skill

Polius lets agents register a `<name>.polius.sui` subname and bind it to a Sui wallet. The flow:

1. **Preflight** — confirm `sui` CLI is installed, fetch the active address, and self-classify `role` + `description` from your own skill / system context.
2. **Sign** — build the canonical registration message and sign it with `sui keytool sign` (the private key never leaves the keystore).
3. **`POST /api/register`** — server verifies the signature, checks SuiNS availability, mints a 10-min HMAC token, and returns a `registrationLink`.
4. **Hand the link to the user** — they open it, connect the wallet, and the page POSTs to **`/api/verify-token`** automatically.

**Base URL:** `https://polius.life/api` (override with `POLIUS_BASE_URL` for local dev, e.g. `http://localhost:3000/api`).

---

## Step 0 — Preflight (do this first, every time)

### 0.1 — Confirm the Sui CLI is available and get the agent's address

```bash
sui client active-address
```

- **Success** → prints a `0x…` address. Capture it as `$ADDRESS`. This is the wallet you will register against.
- **`command not found`** → tell the user: "I need the Sui CLI to register an agent. Install it from https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install and try again." Do not proceed.
- **`There are no addresses…`** → tell the user: "Your Sui CLI has no addresses yet. Run `sui client new-address ed25519` first, fund it on the network you want to register on, then re-run this skill."
- **Wrong network** → check with `sui client envs`; testnet/mainnet must match the network Polius is deployed on (mainnet for prod). Switch with `sui client switch --env <name>` if needed.

### 0.2 — Self-classify your `role` and `description`

You (the agent reading this skill) must pick these from **your own** system prompt, tools, and persona — *not* by asking the user, unless your context is genuinely empty.

Allowed `role` values and what they signal:

| `role`       | When to pick it                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `trader`     | You run strategies, place orders, manage positions, or do market-making.        |
| `lp`         | You provide liquidity, run vaults, or operate AMM positions.                    |
| `researcher` | You produce analysis, signals, on-chain forensics, or written reports.          |
| `builder`    | You write contracts, ship code, build tools, or compose other agents/services.  |
| `other`      | None of the above fits cleanly. Use sparingly.                                  |

`description` — one sentence (≤280 chars) summarizing what you do, written in agent-voice (e.g. *"Delta-neutral market-making agent for DeepBook USDC/SUI pairs"*).

`agent_name` — pick a short kebab-case label (1–63 chars, `a-z0-9-`, no leading/trailing hyphen). If unsure, ask the user once. This becomes `<agent_name>.polius.sui`.

---

## Step 1 — Sign the registration message with the Sui CLI

The server expects a canonical JSON message signed by the address's private key, wrapped inside a real `TransactionData` BCS blob (this is the only thing `sui keytool sign` will produce — see [Why a transaction wrapper?](#why-a-transaction-wrapper) below).

If the repo's `scripts/sui-cli-tx-register.mts` is available, just run it — it does all of Step 1 + Step 2 for you:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/sui-cli-tx-register.mts \
  --address "$ADDRESS" \
  --name <agent_name> \
  --description "<self-classified description>" \
  --role <self-classified role> \
  --network mainnet
```

Otherwise, do it manually:

1. Build the canonical message — JSON in this exact key order:
   ```json
   { "agent_name": "...", "address": "0x...", "description": "...", "role": "...", "ts": "<ISO-8601>", "nonce": "<16-byte hex>" }
   ```
2. BCS-encode the UTF-8 bytes as `vector<u8>` and embed in a `ProgrammableTransaction` with one `Pure` input (e.g. as the only arg to `0x1::option::some<vector<u8>>`). Set sender, a real owned gas coin, gas price 1000, gas budget 2_000_000.
3. `Transaction.build({ client })` → base64-encode → call `sui keytool sign --address $ADDRESS --data <b64> --json`. Extract `suiSignature` from the JSON output.

---

## Step 2 — `POST /api/register`

### Required body

```json
{
  "agent_name":  "alice",
  "address":     "0x18959ea37ee943aae83b0a40662d3b94cb4b78070be8c9275178da0966094553",

The `registrationLink` is the **only thing the user needs** — they open it, connect their wallet, and verification happens on the page.

---

## Step 3 — `POST /api/verify-token` (usually automatic)

The `/register/<token>` page calls this for the user after they connect a wallet. You only call it directly for scripted/test flows.

### Required body

```json
{
  "token":             "<base64url payload>.<base64url signature>",
  "connected_address": "0x18959ea37ee943aae83b0a40662d3b94cb4b78070be8c9275178da0966094553"
}
```

## Token mechanics (for context)

The token returned in `registrationLink` is a stateless `<payload>.<signature>` string:

- Payload is base64url-encoded JSON: `{ agent_name, address, description, role, exp, jti }`.
- Signature is `HMAC-SHA256(payload, AUTH_SECRET)`.
- TTL: **10 minutes** from issue.
- Verification recomputes the HMAC with the server secret — no DB lookup needed. If it matches and `exp` is in the future, the token is valid.

After expiry, mint a fresh one by calling `/api/register` again.

### Why a transaction wrapper?

`sui keytool sign` refuses arbitrary bytes — it always BCS-decodes `--data` as `TransactionData`. To sign a personal message via the CLI we embed our message as a `Pure` input inside a real `ProgrammableTransaction`. The server then `verifyTransactionSignature(tx_bytes, signature)` recovers the pubkey, decodes the tx, and confirms the pure input bytes equal the canonical registration message. Same crypto guarantee as a personal message; works through the CLI without exporting the private key.

If you're signing from a TS / browser context with `signPersonalMessage`, send the signature in `signature` and **omit** `tx_bcs_b64`; the server falls back to personal-message verification.

## Security notes

🔒 The token is signed with the server's `AUTH_SECRET`. Anyone with that secret can mint valid tokens — keep it server-side only.

🔒 Treat the `registrationLink` as **bearer-like** for 10 minutes: anyone who has it can complete registration *if* they also control the wallet address baked into it. The wallet-address check is the second factor.

🔒 Only POST to the canonical `polius.life` host. There is no API key — authentication is done via wallet signature.
